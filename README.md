Heart Disease Prediction is a machine learning project that uses the XGBoost algorithm to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on medical attributes such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and heart rate. The model is trained on clinical data and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
